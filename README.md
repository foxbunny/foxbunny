# 👋 Hey, I’m Hajime

Senior Frontend Developer with 20+ years building scalable web applications and leading engineering teams. I optimize the utilization of browser native capabilities to achieve dramatic productivity gains—often 10× improvements.

I continuously expand my technical repertoire, building runtime type systems that eliminate entire bug classes, complete MVU frameworks that streamline development workflows, and currently developing Fugge—a local-first project management tool with predictive timeline algorithms that help teams consistently hit deadlines.
